"""Test fixtures against a REAL PostgreSQL instance.

Constraint #13: Alembic's --sql offline mode proves the migration code runs,
not that Postgres accepts the DDL. Every schema test here talks to a real
database started by `docker compose up -d postgres`.

The `db` fixture's rollback-after-yield only undoes a test's OWN uncommitted
work. It does nothing about rows a test wrote through code that commits
internally - and every real ingester in this codebase does exactly that
(record_run's `await db.commit()`), by design, to match production
behaviour. Without an explicit reset, every test run permanently writes real
rows into this database and nothing ever cleans them up, so a later test
run's "clean" assertions (e.g. asserting N new rows were written) silently
start depending on whatever a PRIOR run happened to leave behind - a bug
that surfaced empirically as a flaky `written > 0` failure only after
several tasks' tests had accumulated real data here. TRUNCATE at the start
of every test is what actually guarantees isolation.
