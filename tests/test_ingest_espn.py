"""ESPN sync: one live smoke test plus offline unit tests for _upsert_event.

The live test is marked `live` because it makes a real network call. Run
explicitly with `pytest -m live`; excluded from the default suite. The
`_upsert_event` tests below construct fake event payloads directly and never
touch the network, so they run in the default suite like any other test.
