"""Line tables are append-only and write on change, not on poll.

Polling every five minutes while a line sits still would otherwise write
garbage. Note there is deliberately NO unique index enforcing this: a line
can move away and come back (-3 -> -3.5 -> -3), and that return is real
movement. A unique constraint would wrongly reject it, so the check is
application-level and this test is what protects it.
