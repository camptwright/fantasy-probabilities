"""Append-only line writes, deduplicated on value rather than on time.

There is deliberately no unique index backing this. A line can move away and
return to a previous value, and that return is genuine market movement; a
unique constraint on (game, market, side, source, line, price) would reject
it. The comparison is therefore against the LATEST observation only.
