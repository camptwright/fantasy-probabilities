    """Create or update the Game for one ESPN event.

    Team resolution is deliberately run BEFORE a brand-new Game is ever
    constructed or added to the session. `games.season` is NOT NULL, and
    once a pending Game satisfies every NOT NULL constraint, any query
    issued on this session (e.g. resolve_team()'s own SELECT for the very
    next competitor, or the next event's lookup) autoflushes the whole unit
    of work - which would silently INSERT a half-built Game (valid team IDs
    still unknown) before we've even learned whether resolution will
    succeed. Resolving first means a malformed event never gets a pending
    row in the session in the first place, so there is nothing to discard
    if it turns out incomplete - this is a stronger guarantee than adding
    the Game early and expunging it after the fact, which would already be
    too late if an intervening query had autoflushed it.

    If the Game already exists (a prior successful sync gave it valid team
    IDs) and THIS poll's competitor data is incomplete, the existing valid
    team IDs are kept untouched; only the team assignment is skipped, while
    schedule/status/score fields this poll does legitimately know are still
    applied. Either way, a failure is recorded on `run.detail` so a
    persistently malformed event doesn't go unnoticed.

    A brand-new event (no existing row for this espn_event_id) is resolved
    through resolve_game() rather than unconditionally constructed, so a
    Game nflverse already seeded for this exact fixture (keyed only on
    nflverse_game_id, matched here by team pair + kickoff window) gets
    espn_event_id backfilled onto it instead of gaining a duplicate row -
    without which closing (nflverse) and live (ESPN) lines for the same
