"""Underdog player props.

CONSTRAINT #17: the response is one document with five sibling arrays, and a
line names its player only through
line.over_under.appearance_stat.appearance_id -> appearances[].player_id ->
players[].id. That traversal lives in the preserved provider, verified
against 3,841 live lines, and is reused here rather than reimplemented.

There is no teams array, so a prop's game cannot be resolved from this
payload. game_id is left null; joining props to fixtures is a later concern
and guessing it here would attach lines to the wrong game.

Underdog's own provider already labels college-football rows "ncaaf" (its
`sport_id` is "CFB" - see underdog_api.py's _SPORT_ID_MAP), so supporting a
second sport here is exactly the filter change below, not new parsing.
