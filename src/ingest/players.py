    """Resolve a player-stat row to its game.

    nflverse player stats carry season, week, and the player's team - not a
    game_id. Season and week alone match roughly sixteen games, so the team
    is REQUIRED to disambiguate; without it every player's statistics would
    attach to an arbitrary game that week.

    The team column is `recent_team` in nflreadr's published dictionary;
    the live nflverse release ingested here (verified 2026-08-20) actually
    exposes it as `team`. Both are accepted rather than guessing which this
    version emits.

    Also filtered on `game_type`/postseason-vs-regular: ESPN's sync now
    writes Game rows with its own game_type (see src/ingest/espn.py's
    _game_type_and_week()), and resolve_game()'s team-pair + kickoff-window
    matching is a best-effort convergence, not a guarantee - if it ever
    misses, season+week+team alone could match more than one row (e.g. an
    unreconciled ESPN row sharing this team/week/season). This filter is
    what stops db.scalar() from picking one of them arbitrarily even in
    that case, matching this function's own docstring promise that this
    lookup is what stands between correct and arbitrary stat attribution.
