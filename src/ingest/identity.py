"""The single place any source looks up or creates a Team.

CONSTRAINT #24: historical seeding and live sync must not create separate
Team rows for the same franchise. nflverse publishes abbreviations ("KC"),
ESPN publishes display names ("Kansas City Chiefs"); neither matches the
other. Both paths run through here, so whichever arrives first creates the
canonical row and the second attaches to it.

Sport dimension (added 2026-08-29, overriding the data-foundation plan's
"NFL only" constraint - see CLAUDE.md): every alias lookup and every Team
row is scoped by sport. ESPN's own numeric team ids are assigned per sport,
not globally, so an unscoped lookup could silently attach an NCAAF result
to an NFL team id that happens to match.
