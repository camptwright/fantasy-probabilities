"""Quota-guarded team-market polling from The Odds API.

CONSTRAINT #4: three defences, all from day one - season-aware polling,
generous intervals, and this quota guard reading x-requests-remaining. The
free tier allows 500 requests per month; below a configured floor of
remaining requests, the guard sets a Redis key with a 24h TTL that
suppresses all further polling until it expires.

CONSTRAINT #22: the quota helpers below take an explicit `redis` client
parameter rather than reaching for a module-level cached one. That is what
keeps them correct from both the FastAPI process (one persistent event
loop) and a Celery task (fresh event loop per invocation) - do not add a
global/cached Redis client here.

Verified 2026-08-21 against a live fixture (tests/fixtures/theodds_nfl.json,
one request against the 500/month budget): the historical endpoint is
restricted to paid plans and billed at ten times the cost of current odds,
so this module polls current odds only. Player props are billed per
market-region combination and are not fetched here; Underdog is the props
source.
